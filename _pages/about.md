I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [ECE](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en), [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr). I am a member of the Computer Architecture and Systems Lab, advised by [Prof. Jaewoong Sim](https://jaewoong.org/). <br />
I received my B.S. degree from [Seoul National University](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en) in electrical and computer engineering (2024).

My research interests are in computer architecture, particularly in providing an efficient accelerator system for emerging workloads, such as neural rendering.
