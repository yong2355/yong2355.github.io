Hi! I am a first-year M.S. student at [ECE](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en), [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr). I am currently advised by [Prof. Jaewoong Sim](https://jaewoong.org/) and a member of the Computer Architecture and Systems Lab. <br />
I received my B.S. degree from [Seoul National University](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en) (2024).

I have general research interests in GPU microarchitecture and the architectural support for emerging workloads, particularly graphics tasks such as neural rendering, in mobile/edge computing platforms.
